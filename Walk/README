This is the pipeline to extract walking parameters from IMU signals. The main pipeline file is FeatureExtractionPipeline.mlx 
Important note:
1. To be able to use this pipeline, you need walking segmentation files. If not, please open WalkSegmentation folder. 
2. This pipeline uses segmented gait file as an input and calculates several output parameters. To see the list of output parameters please open Parameters.mat
3. All MATLAB functions in this folder are necessary and keep all.
