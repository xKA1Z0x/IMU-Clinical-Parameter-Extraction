Versions of the code:

_v1: initial code borrowed from Francesco (source: \\fs2.smpp.local\RTO\STARS\Inpatient Study\Analysis\STARS_Inpatient_Step03_XSens_GaitSegmentation_v1), added with a few comments

_v2: code manipulated to accept P2C input
     also, removed the cut over the first 2 meters
     in addition, the modality the user can interact for peak detection is slightly extended
     lastly, different processes for manual peak detection are inserted for the 10MWT wrt 2MWT and 6MWT

_v2 - REMOTE VERSION: this is the version created for the volunteed (LW). The content is the exact same as v2, but in this case the user has to manually select the files to process
 (i.e., all the for cycles automatically entering the folder architecture of the dataset are removed)
